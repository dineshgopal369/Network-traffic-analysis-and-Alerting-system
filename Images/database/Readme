#Database used  Mariadb
To get started, you will need to create a new database.
Once the database is created, you need to create a table within it.
The structure of the table should match the schema provided in the file "database table schema.png".
After creating the table, you will need to provide your credentials in the "database" section of the "traffic.py" file.
Specifically, you should enter your username and database name.
